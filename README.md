Image-Depth-Perception
======================

An attempt at simulating depth perception using image analysis (C and MIPS).

This program generates a depth map that calculates the differences in coloration between two images.

The program also creates a "quadtree," a recursive data structure that makes a tree-like representation of a depth-map using its color values.
